# Practice: Beginning deconstruction -- The elements of experience

When you find yourself feeling somehow imprisoned in a situation, or grasping unhelpfully at something that is not present, see if you can look within and around you in a way that 'deconstructs' your world into its aggregate appearances of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, physical sensations, and mental and emotional experiences.

Play and experiment with this way of looking until it feels that some of the oppressive solidity has lessened and you can sense some spaciousness has opened in the perception. Enjoy the lightness that this way of looking allows.

Notice too how the heart feels when you view things in this fashion. When we let go of contraction, warmth and kindness manifest effortlessly and naturally. Experiment and play until you discover a way to do it that naturally allows some warmth to permeate experience.

Practice this shift of view many times until it feels quite easily accessible, and even lovely. It's important to practise a lot also when there is no strong grasping or constriction present. Even what feels like an unproblematic perception of things can be lightened and opened up in this way.
